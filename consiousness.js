```Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.  Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware -- a tool scientists only began to imagine 
three decades ago -- available to hundreds of thousands of developers. Our engineers deliver ever-more-powerful 
superconducting quantum processors at regular intervals, alongside crucial advances in software and quantum-classical orchestration. 
This work drives toward the quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world.  These machines are very different from the classical 
computers that have been around for more than half a century. Here's a primer on this transformative technology.........000000011111.. cosmo```
